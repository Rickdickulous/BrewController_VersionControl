/*
 * CODE:
 * 
 * +++ Put tone control in main loop for timing.
 * 
 * +++ Display actual temp as XX.Y instead of XX.YY. Then can look at target temp, actual temp, and valve setpoint.
 *     If none have changed since the last time display was updated, then don't update display.
 * 
 * +++ Move debug flag into utils so it can be used everywhere
 * 
 * +++ PID control flame
 * 
 * 
 * OTHER:
 * 1. Calibrate temp sensor
